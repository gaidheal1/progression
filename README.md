# progression - life in co-op mode

## Introduction

Need a boost to start or finish some work? This game is the first (that I’ve heard of) to present the Player and the Character as two separate entities. 

### Player

The Player (you) enters an activity to pursue in the real world, which fuels the Character's ability to do quests.

### Character

The Character takes quests and follows stories, as you guide them on their path in life by whispering in their ear.

## What's involved

Multiple game elements are involved, all aimed at increasing the Player's enjoyment and thus the likelihood they’ll return.

- Direct rewards (XP and levelling)
- Compelling stories (Player enjoys Character’s questing experience vicariously)
- Body doubling (Player and Character both work together simultaneously)
- Immersive world (NPCs could have their own daily, seasonal and annual schedules)
- Meaningful interactions (Character could interact with NPCs and environment)
- Dopamine hits (enticing features found in eg gacha games like daily login rewards)
- Other exciting future possibilities involving new game mechanics
